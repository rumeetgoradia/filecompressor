In order to test our program we detailed a number of possible errors that could occur. Within command line input testing we tested what would be displayed when:
		1)An incorrect number of arguments were entered
		2)There were incorrect flags
		3)The file in the file field did not have the correct permissions
		4)The file in the file field did not exist
		5)There was an improper file in the codebook field for compression/decompression
		6)There was a non .hcz file in the file field for decompression
Through all of these test cases, a proper error message was displayed.


In terms of basic testing for a directory with a non-recusive input, we tested scenarios such as:
		1)If the file was empty
		2)What would happen if compress is called on a file whose tokens are not in the Huffman codebook
		3)Files with one token
		4)Files wih multiple tokens

For the first scenario, the program would display an error message and completely exit. For the other scenarios, operation worked as expected.


In terms of basic testing for a directory with a recursive input, we tested scenarios such as:
		1)What would happen if a directory has multiple levels of sub directories, empty and non-empty
		2)If there are directories with multiple sub-directories but only one file
		3)If there are direcroties with a combination of sub-directories and files 
		4)Whether a file in the file field would behave just as if no recursion was called
		5)What would happen if a directory was empty

For all five of these scenarios, the program worked as expected.


In terms of both recursive and non-recursive testing we tested scenarios such as:
		1)Whether decompression and compression will work if the Huffman codebook is in another directory

For this scenario, we found that our program does work even if the codebook is in another directory
